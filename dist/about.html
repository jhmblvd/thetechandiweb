                <p>I hold a Masters Degree in Technology Management. I enjoy finding technology solutions for
                    businesses! I have worked across various technology domains in my 20 years as Technologist.
                    Over the years, I have learned that there is no one size that meets all. Working with knowledge I've
                    gained over various
                    domains it's fun finding the solution that fit the specific needs of a person or business.
                    <p> Technology is fluid and constantly changing, and this requires a dedication to a life of
                        learning
                        as well as being open to new technologies and solutions.</p>

                <p>I have been working on the net for many years. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Json, micro-services, and
                    serverless technologies to enhance and
                    build solutions that work.

                        Adobe. Transitions from paper to electronic
                        carry risks and must be carefully thought out.
